# College-Predictor-Web-App
Built a full-stack, data-driven web application using Flask to instantly predict eligible engineering colleges (e.g., based on JEE Main cutoffs) for students. The application centralizes historical cutoff data, automating the complex college counseling process and providing filtered, accurate results based on user credentials.
